* Modularity! Modularity!! Modularity!!!
* Always make sure that you name the variables appropriately.

* Follow a general pattern. It should be clear what a function does and returns. stick to the standards.
* Experiment as much as possible before you use some thing in production.
* Open source almost everything as much as possible.
* Composability - Always keep this in your mind.
* Never change a function signature that some one else has written without discussing with your team first. This is the most stupidest thing to do.
* Write kick ass test cases. This will drag you in the beginning, but trust me, this will hold your back in the long run.
* Write as much extensive documentation as possible. 
* Build a CI server. Have it test your code each time you commit your code. That way, everyone will immediately know if something is broken.
* Always stick to the standards and general patterns as much as possible. By that way, any new member in the team can figure things on himself without much help from the others.
* If the logic / idea behind the code is not obvious, either write a crystal clear documentation or rewrite the code so it is obvious.
* Remove redundant pieces of code, UI or anything.
* Never update / upgrade / modify a production server before intensive testing. If there are any compelling reasons to update your server, have an Identical staging server, update / upgrade it, run your kick-ass test cases and if everything seems to be right, then you may continue updating your production server.
